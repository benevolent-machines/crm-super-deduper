That's how many comparisons it takes to find the near duplicates among a million records.  That's why it's a super hard task to do for larger datasets.  As the number of records increase, the number of needed comparisons rises exponentially:  

* 10 -> 45 😃
* 100 -> 4,950 😊
* 1,000 -> 499,500 😐
* 10,000 -> 49,995,000 😟
* 100,000 -> 4,999,950,000 😖
* 1,000,000 -> 499,999,500,000 😱
* 10,000,000 -> 49,999,995,000,000 🤯

Deduplicating address data in CRM systems is essential. Duplicate customer data can lead to a myriad of problems that directly impact the quality of customer service, the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, and the accuracy of sales forecasts. Ensuring each customer has a unique record enhances personalized service and operational efficiency, directly impacting business growth and customer satisfaction. 

The CRM Super Deduper, an open-source tool, streamlines the identification of duplicate CRM records, efficiently handling millions of entries with ease. Leveraging advanced data science methodologies such as TF/IDF scoring, nearest neighbor algorithms, and multi-pass masking, it transforms a complex challenge into a manageable task that completes in minutes. This approach not only simplifies the deduplication process but also ensures quick and effective results using readily accessible resources.

The deduplication process is streamlined for simplicity and efficiency:

* **Start Easily**: Open an example notebook in a secure, temporary Google Colab session.
* **Load Your Data**: Import a CSV file of addresses exported from your CRM.
* **Customize Configuration**: Tailor the settings to meet your specific requirements.
* **Execute the Process**: Run the deduplication with just a click.
* **Retrieve Results**: Download the results in a nicely formatted spreadsheet. For added convenience, where supported, obtain optional links directly connecting your matches to their corresponding record views and merge functions in your CRM.

This approach ensures a hassle-free experience, enabling you to efficiently clean your CRM data with precision and ease.
